# ALX Listing App

## Project Overview

The **ALX Listing App** is an Airbnb clone focused on building a robust and scalable listing page. The primary goal of this project is to establish a solid foundation using Next.js and TypeScript, enabling the development of reusable components and a maintainable codebase. This project demonstrates best practices in project structure, configuration, and modern tooling.
